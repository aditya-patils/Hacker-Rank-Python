"""
Problem Statement:
------------------
In this challenge, the user enters a string and a substring. 
You have to print the number of times that the substring occurs in the given string. 
String traversal will take place from left to right, not from right to left.

NOTE: String letters are case-sensitive.

Input Format:
-------------
The first line of input contains the original string.
The second line contains the substring.

Output Format:
--------------
Output a single integer: the total number of occurrences of the substring in the original string.

Constraints:
------------
- Each character in the string is an ASCII character.

Sample Input:
--------------
ABCDCDC
CDC

Sample Output:
--------------
2

Time Complexity Analysis:
-------------------------
- Let n = length of the main string
- Let m = length of the substring

1. The loop runs (n - m + 1) times.
2. Each substring comparison (string[i:i+m]) takes O(m) time in the worst case.
3. Therefore, total time complexity = O(n * m).
4. Space complexity = O(1), since we only use a counter variable.

        # and i = 2 â†’ string[2:5] = "CDC".
